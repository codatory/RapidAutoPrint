# RapidAutoPrint
Prints files in a specified directory very quickly using Filesystem Notifications

# Usage
Currently the program supports no configuration, so you will need to create a folder c:\printme. Any PDF file placed into that file will be printed to the system's default printer and then deleted.

# Downloading
Pre-compiled binaries are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/codatory/RapidAutoPrint/releases).

# Contributing
Pull requests and Issues welcome!
