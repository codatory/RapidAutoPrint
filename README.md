# RapidAutoPrint
Prints files in a specified directory very quickly using Filesystem Notifications

# Usage
On first run, the program will create a config file by asking you what folder and filetypes you want to monitor for. You'll need a program that can properly read & print the files you plan on printing, and it will print to your default printer. For testing, I recommend the XPS or PDF printer from Microsoft so you don't waste paper!
